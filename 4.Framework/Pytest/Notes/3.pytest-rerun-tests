# Rerunning Failed Tests from a Previous Run -

  1. pytest --lf or pytest --last-failed:
    => This command will only run the tests that failed in the immediately preceding Pytest execution.
    This is useful for quickly verifying fixes.

  2. pytest --ff or pytest --failed-first:
    => This command runs all tests, but prioritizes and runs the tests that failed in the previous run first.
    This allows for a quick check of the failed tests while still ensuring all tests are eventually executed.

  3. Using plug-in pytest-rerunfailures (Automatically Retrying Flaky Tests)
    => For tests that might occasionally fail due to transient/env issues (flaky tests),
    the pytest-rerunfailures plugin can be used to automatically retry them.

    pip install pytest-rerunfailures

    Usage:
    Globally: To retry all failed tests a specified number of times:
    pytest --reruns <number_of_retries> [e.g. pytest --reruns 3 ]
    It will retry failed tests up to 3 times.

    @pytest.mark.flaky decorator:
    To mark individual tests for automatic retries

        @pytest.mark.flaky(retries=5)
        def test_flaky_example():
            # Your test code here, which might occasionally fail
            pass
