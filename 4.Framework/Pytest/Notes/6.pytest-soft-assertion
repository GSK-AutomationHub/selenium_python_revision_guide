# Soft vs Hard assertion
    Hard assertions:
    => immediately stop test execution upon failure.

    Soft assertions:
    => allow test execution to continue even after an assertion fails,
    collecting all failures and reporting them at the end of the test function

    Soft assertions installation
    pip install pytest-soft-assertions

    How to do Soft assertion
    pytest --soft-asserts your_test_file.py
    pytest-check is another method
